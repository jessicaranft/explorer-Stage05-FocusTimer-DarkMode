![preview](./.github/preview-focustimer-darkmode.png)

This was the second challenge of Stage 05 from my Web Development course, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I took the [2.0 timer created in the first challenge](https://github.com/jessicaranft/explorer-Stage05-FocusTimer/) and added a volume control and dark & light options.

### Features:

- Buttons with play and pause functions
- Buttons to add and remove 5 minutes from the timer
- 4 background sounds options
- Volume slider
- Dark & Light layout options

### Extras features outside the challenge:

- An alarm sound when the counter gets to 0
- The stop button sets thet timer value to its initial state

### Other details:

- The layout was based on a Figma design.

- It's a responsive layout with different mobile and desktop versions.
